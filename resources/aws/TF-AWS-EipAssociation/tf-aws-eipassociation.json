Instead use the `allocation_id` available in those resources to allow AWS to manage the association, otherwise you will see `AuthFailure` errors.\n\n~> **NOTE:** `aws_eip_association` is useful in scenarios where EIPs are either\npre-existing or distributed to customers or users and therefore cannot be changed.",
