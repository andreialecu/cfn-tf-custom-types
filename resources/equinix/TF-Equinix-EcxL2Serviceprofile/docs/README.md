minutes. Without API Integration, additional manual steps will be required and the
provisioning will likely take longer
- `authkey_label` - (Optional) Name of the authentication key label to be used by
the Authentication Key service. It allows Service
Providers with QinQ ports to accept groups of connections or VLANs from Dot1q
customers. This is similar to S-Tag/C-Tag capabilities

multiple connections
can be created with the same authorization key to connect to this service profile
after the first connection has been approved by the seller

alert them when they need to add more ports or when they need to create
a new service profile. Required with `oversubscription_allowed`, defaults to "1x"
