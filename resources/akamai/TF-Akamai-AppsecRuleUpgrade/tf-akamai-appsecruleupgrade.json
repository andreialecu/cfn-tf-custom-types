    "description": "Use the `akamai_appsec_rule_upgrade` resource to upgrade to the most recent version of the KRS rule set. Akamai periodically updates these rules to keep protections current. However, the rules you use in your security policies do not automatically upgrade to the latest version when using mode: KRS. These rules do update automatically when you have mode set to AAG. Before you upgrade, run Get upgrade details to see which rules have changed. If you want to test how these rules would operate with live traffic before committing to the upgrade, run them in evaluation mode. This applies to KRS rules only and does not allow you to make any changes to the rules themselves. The response is the same as the mode response.",
