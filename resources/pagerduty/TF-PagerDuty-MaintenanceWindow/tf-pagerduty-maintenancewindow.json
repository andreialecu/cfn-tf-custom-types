    "description": "A [maintenance window](https://v2.developer.pagerduty.com/v2/page/api-reference#!/Maintenance_Windows/get_maintenance_windows) is used to temporarily disable one or more services for a set period of time. No incidents will be triggered and no notifications will be received while a service is disabled by a maintenance window.\n\nMaintenance windows are specified to start at a certain time and end after they have begun. Once started, a maintenance window cannot be deleted; it can only be ended immediately to re-enable the service.",
