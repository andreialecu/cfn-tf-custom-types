For example, if three different S3 resources are generating the same compliance event, only one AWS event is created on the AWS CloudWatch event bus.\n* **Resources**: Multiple AWS CloudWatch events will be created when multiple resources are generating the same compliance event. For example, if three different S3 resources are generating the same compliance event, three AWS events are created on the AWS CloudWatch event bus."
