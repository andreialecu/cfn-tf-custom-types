    "description": "This resource allows you to add/update/delete a specific device in a Panorama\ndevice group.\n\nThis resource has some overlap with the `panos_panorama_device_group`\nresource.  If you want to use this resource with the other one, then make\nsure that your `panos_panorama_device_group` spec does not define any\n`device` blocks, and just stays as \"computed\".\n\nThis is the appropriate resource to use if you have a pre-existing device group\nin Panorama and don't want Terraform to delete it on `terraform destroy`.\n\nAn interesting side effect of the underlying XML API - if the device group does\nnot already exist, then this resource can actually create it.  However, since\nonly the single entry for the specific serial number is deleted, then a\n`terraform destroy` would not remove the device group itself in this situation.",
