It also sets the maximum size of the wait queue to 3x this value, if you have enabled indexer acknowledgment (useACK=true).\nAlthough the wait queue and the output queues are both configured by this attribute, they are separate queues. The setting determines the maximum size of the queue in-memory (RAM) buffer.\nFor heavy forwarders sending parsed data, maxQueueSize is the maximum number of events. Since events are typically much shorter than data blocks, the memory consumed by the queue on a parsing forwarder is likely to be much smaller than on a non-parsing forwarder, if you use this version of the setting.\nIf specified as a lone integer (for example, maxQueueSize=100), maxQueueSize indicates the maximum number of queued events (for parsed data) or blocks of data (for unparsed data). A block of data is approximately 64KB. For non-parsing forwarders, such as universal forwarders, that send unparsed data, maxQueueSize is the maximum number of data blocks.\nIf specified as an integer followed by KB, MB, or GB (for example, maxQueueSize=100MB), maxQueueSize indicates the maximum RAM allocated to the queue buffer. Defaults to 500KB (which means a maximum size of 500KB for the output queue and 1500KB for the wait queue, if any)."
