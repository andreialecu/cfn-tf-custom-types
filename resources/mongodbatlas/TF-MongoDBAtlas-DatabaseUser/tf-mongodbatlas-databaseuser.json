    "description": "`mongodbatlas_database_user` provides a Database User resource. This represents a database user which will be applied to all clusters within the project.\n\nEach user has a set of roles that provide access to the project\u2019s databases. User's roles apply to all the clusters in the project: if two clusters have a `products` database and a user has a role granting `read` access on the products database, the user has that access on both clusters.\n\n-> **NOTE:** Groups and projects are synonymous terms. You may find group_id in the official documentation.\n\n~> **IMPORTANT:** All arguments including the password will be stored in the raw state as plain-text.
