For more information see\n[the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-custom-roles)\nand\n[API](https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/organizations.roles).\n\n~> **Warning:** Note that custom roles in GCP have the concept of a soft-delete. There are two issues that may arise\n from this and how roles are propagated. 1) creating a role may involve undeleting and then updating a role with the\n same name, possibly causing confusing behavior between undelete and update. 2) A deleted role is permanently deleted\n after 7 days, but it can take up to 30 more days (i.e. between 7 and 37 days after deletion) before the role name is\n made available again. This means a deleted role that has been deleted for more than 7 days cannot be changed at all\n by Terraform, and new roles cannot share that name.",
