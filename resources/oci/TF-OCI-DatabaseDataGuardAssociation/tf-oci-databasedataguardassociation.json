A Data Guard association represents the replication relationship between the\nspecified database and a peer database. For more information, see [Using Oracle Data Guard](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Database/Tasks/usingdataguard.htm).\n\nAll Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources, including Data Guard associations, get an Oracle-assigned, unique ID\ncalled an Oracle Cloud Identifier (OCID). When you create a resource, you can find its OCID in the response.\nYou can also retrieve a resource's OCID by using a List API operation on that resource type, or by viewing the\nresource in the Console.
