    "description": "This resource provides the Subnet resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core service.\n\nCreates a new subnet in the specified VCN. You can't change the size of the subnet after creation,\nso it's important to think about the size of subnets you need before creating them.\nFor more information, see [VCNs and Subnets](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingVCNs.htm).\nFor information on the number of subnets you can have in a VCN, see\n[Service Limits](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/servicelimits.htm).\n\nFor the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the compartment where you want the subnet\nto reside. Notice that the subnet doesn't have to be in the same compartment as the VCN, route tables, or\nother Networking Service components. If you're not sure which compartment to use, put the subnet in\nthe same compartment as the VCN. For more information about compartments and access control, see\n[Overview of the IAM Service](https://docs.cloud.or...",
